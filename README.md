# ea-bootcamp-hometowns
This repository is used for a guided activity on collaboration in the Earth Analytics Bootcamp. 

The original activity was developed and taught by Jonah Duckles (https://github.com/jduckles/git-collaboration), and then later modified by Leah and Max Joseph at Earth Lab, CU Boulder (https://github.com/earthlab/14ers-git). 

This text was added by Emily for a test.
