    "West Lafayette, IN is home to Purdue, a large university. However, my experience living and visiting there has shown me that the real attraction for the locals is something a little more down to earth that higher education. The people of Indiana love corn and cornfields. They make corn mazes, gauge the climate based on corn height, have weird bonfire parties in or near their cornfields, etc.   \n",
